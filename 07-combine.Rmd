## Combining Data

Often we'll find ourselves in the situation where we have some data but we want to increase its usefulness by adding on additional data. This section will cover the various ways we can take two dataframes and combine them together into a single dataframe.

### Binds

Sometimes we have datasets that contain the same columns, or the same rows but might are in two separate files or variables because they were collected that way or some other reason, and we want to bring them back together.

#### Row binds

In the situation where we have new observations (rows) but the same variables (columns) that we want to add onto our existing dataframe, we call this row binding.

```{r}
dogs_dunedin <- data.frame(names = c("zippo", "sky", "nova"), dog_breed = c("poodle", "labrador", "bulldog"))
dogs_dunedin

dogs_christchurch <- data.frame(names = c("flash", "dog", "jess"), dog_breed = c("terrier", "collie", "collie"))
dogs_christchurch
```


```{r}
dogs <- rbind(dogs_dunedin, dogs_christchurch)
dogs
```

Note that if your column names don't match between your dataframes you will get an error when you try to do your row bind.

\

#### Column binding

**Caution needs to be applied when using column binding.** Column binding relies entirely upon the rows being in the correct order and there is no enforcement of relationships that may have been present and it's entirely possible for the row order to have been changed in one or both dataframes prior to the bind. 


```{r}
pet_weights <- data.frame(animal = c("dog", "cat", "turtle"), weight_kg = c(21, 3, 14) )
pet_weights


pet_names <- data.frame(name = c("tbone", "slink", "speedy"), animal_type = c("dog", "cat", "turtle"))
pet_names


pets <- cbind(pet_weights, pet_names)
pets
```
Here is the same data, except one has had the rows reordered prior to the bind to demonstrate 

```{r}
pet_weights_ordered <- pet_weights %>% arrange(weight_kg)
pet_weights_ordered

pets2 <- cbind(pet_weights_ordered, pet_names)
pets2
```

It's also entirey possible to end up with duplicate column names, making future subsetting more challenging.

```{r}
pet_weights <- data.frame(animal = c("dog", "cat", "turtle"), weight_kg = c(21, 3, 14) )
pet_weights


pet_names <- data.frame(name = c("tbone", "slink", "speedy"), animal = c("collie", "short hair", "snapping"))
pet_names


pets3 <- cbind(pet_weights, pet_names)
pets3

# pulls out first instance of column name
pets3$animal
```
It's for this reason that when we're wanting to add columns that we are better off doing so in way where we can specify the relationship between the datasets. This is where **joins** come in.
\  
  
### Joins

Joins are used when we have relationships between our data.

As part of the `nycflights13` package we also have some other dataframes available, `airports`, `planes`, and `airlines`. We can use these datasets to add on extra information to our tables: 

```{r}
glimpse(airports)

glimpse(planes)

glimpse(airlines)

glimpse(weather)
```

Ultimately we want to use the relationships between the data to find out the name of the airline that flew the total furthest distance using single engine planes.

But before we tackle that question, we first need to cover how to combine different data together using **joins** or **merges**. In order for us to join two dataframes together, we need to have a way of linking the information between the two tables, we need an common-identifier or **key** that is shared between them. Let's examine how joins work using some examples first

```{r}
df_a <- data.frame(names = c("A", "B","C"), animals = c("cat", "dog","mouse"))
df_a


df_b <- data.frame(names = c("A", "C", "D"), counts = c(1, 2, 3))
df_b
```
For joins, we use an identifier column (key) that has entires in common between the two dataframes. The values in this column are then used to match rows between the dataframes and the corresponding columns are brought together. There are three main types of joins we'll look at:



#### Inner Joins

Inner joins will only keep rows that have matching values in the identifier column between the two dataframes. Rows that cannot be matched are removed.

```{r}
inner_join(df_a, df_b, by = "names")
```
#### Directional joins

Directional joins will keep all of the rows with the dataframe specified by the direction, and add on data that matches from the second dataframe. The most commonly used is the left join, but right joins are also used. These joins are usually used when you want to keep all of the data in your starting dataset but you want to add on more information where you can.

```{r}
left_join(df_a, df_b, by = "names")

right_join(df_a, df_b, by = "names")
```


#### Full Joins

Full joins will match by the identifying column, where rows cannot be matched they are filled in with missing data in the columns that are new for the respective dataframe. This type of joins will keep all data.

```{r}
full_join(df_a, df_b, by = "names")
```

#### Joining nycflights

Now that we have an idea about how joins work, lets set about answering our question of which airline flew the total furthest distance using single engine planes.

Here is a diagram from [R for Data Science - Relational Data](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data.html) chapter showing the relationships between the `nycflights13` dataframes.

![R for Data Science - nycflights13 data relationships](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/245292d1ea724f6c3fd8a92063dcd7bfb9758d02/5751b/diagrams/relational-nycflights.png)

\

We can now begin to solve our question in pieces:

\

1. We need to know which planes were single engine
```{r}
single_engine <- planes %>% filter(engines == 1)
```

\

2.  We need to identify which column can be used to link our single engine data with our flights data.

```{r}
# identify column names in common between single_engine and flights
names(single_engine)[names(single_engine) %in% names(flights)]
```

Tailnum is going to identify our planes between our two datasets. It is possible to use multiple keys in joins - however in our case `flights$year` refers to the year of the flight, but `single_engine$year` refers to the year of the aircraft. 

\

3. We now need to join with our flights data so that only the flights involving planes with single engines remain.

```{r}
single_engine_flights <- inner_join(flights, single_engine, by = "tailnum")

names(single_engine_flights)
```

Notice that we have year.x and year.y columns, this is because there were columns that had the same name in our datasets, but were not representing the same data. We can make these more informative going forward by redoing our join and this time supplying a `suffix` parameter so we know which dataset the columns originally were from


```{r}
single_engine_flights <- inner_join(flights, single_engine, by = "tailnum", suffix = c("_flight", "_plane"))

names(single_engine_flights)
```

\

4. Now we'll find the total distance for each carrier

```{r}
total_single_engine_carrier_distance <- single_engine_flights %>% 
  group_by(carrier) %>% 
  summarise(total_distance = sum(distance))
```


5. And now we need to add on the carrier names and sort the result so the longest distance is first. This time we'll do it using pipe.

```{r}
total_single_engine_carrier_distance %>% 
  inner_join(airlines, by = 'carrier') %>% 
  arrange(desc(total_distance))
```

From this we can see that JetBlue Airways flew the longest distance using single-engine planes.
